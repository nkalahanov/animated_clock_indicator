/// A class that defines customizable options for the [AnimatedClockIndicator] widget,
/// allowing you to adjust the appearance and animation behavior of the clock.
///
/// The [AnimatedClockIndicatorOptions] class provides a comprehensive set of parameters
/// to tailor the visual and animation aspects of the [AnimatedClockIndicator]. By adjusting
/// these options, developers can create clock indicators that align with their application's
/// design language and performance requirements.
///
/// The [clockHandsLengthRatio] utilizes the golden ratio (0.618) by default to ensure
/// aesthetically pleasing proportions between the hour and minute hands.

  /// customization of the clock's appearance and behavior.

  /// - [borderWidth]: The thickness of the clock's border in logical pixels. Must be non-negative.
  /// - [minuteHandWidth]: The thickness of the minute hand in logical pixels. Must be non-negative.
  /// - [hourHandWidth]: The thickness of the hour hand in logical pixels. Must be non-negative.
  /// - [handInset]: The distance from the edge of the clock to the tip of the hands in logical pixels. Must be non-negative.
  /// - [clockHandsLengthRatio]: The ratio of the hour hand length to the minute hand length.
  ///   Defaults to 0.618, adhering to the golden ratio for aesthetically pleasing proportions.
  ///   Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
  /// - [minuteHandRotationDuration]: The duration for the minute hand to complete one full rotation.
  ///   Defaults to 1000 milliseconds.
  /// - [minuteToHourRotationRatio]: The ratio between the rotation speeds of the minute and hour hands.
  ///   A value of 12.0 maintains the standard relationship in a traditional clock.
  ///   Must be greater than 0.
  /// - [borderColor]: The color of the clock's border. Defaults to [Colors.black].
  /// - [minuteHandColor]: The color of the minute hand. Defaults to [Colors.black].
  /// - [hourHandColor]: The color of the hour hand. Defaults to [Colors.black].
  /// - [minuteHandStrokeCap] and [hourHandStrokeCap] : The stroke cap style for the clock hands,
  ///   defining the appearance of their ends (e.g., rounded, square, or flat). The stroke cap affects
  ///   the visual style and potential positioning adjustments of each hand's end on the clock face.
  ///   Both default to [StrokeCap.round] for a polished, smooth finish.
